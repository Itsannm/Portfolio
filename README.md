# Ann Mwanzia Portfolio 

## Overview

Welcome to my Full Stack Developer Portfolio! This repository showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a full stack developer. Whether you're a potential employer, collaborator, or just curious about my work, you'll find all the information you need right here.

## About Me
I am a passionate software engineer with a strong foundation in public management. My personality traits include being sanguine and choleric, which make me an energetic, logical thinker who is quick to adapt and creatively solve problems.

## Portfolio Details
 ### Resume Theme
To build my portfolio, I used the Start Bootstrap - Resume theme, which features a fixed sidebar and content sections for an elegant and straightforward presentation of my skills and experiences. You can preview my portfolio here.

### Usage
Basic Usage
After downloading this repository, you can make changes by editing the HTML and CSS files provided. These are the primary files you need to customize to reflect your own experiences and projects. To see your changes, simply open the index.html file in a web browser.

### Advanced Usage
For more advanced users, I've included tools like Gulp for automating tasks such as compiling SCSS to CSS, minifying files, and live-reloading the browser for real-time preview. After installation, you can run npm install to install dependencies and then gulp dev to start a development server.

## Contributions
If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue. Your feedback is invaluable!

## Customization
I have designed this portfolio to represent my unique skills and experiences. If you'd like to create a similar portfolio or require custom development services, you can visit Start Bootstrap's custom design services page.

## About Me
I am a passionate full stack developer with a deep appreciation for technology's transformative potential. I believe in open source collaboration, and I'm excited to contribute to and learn from the developer community.

## License
This portfolio is based on the Start Bootstrap - Resume theme, which is released under the MIT license. My personal content, projects, and experiences are subject to the same license.
